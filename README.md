Description:

This is my first project, a simple Facebook clone built with HTML and CSS. This project features a front page and a profile page, both designed to resemble the basic layout and feel of Facebook. I also implemented a dark theme feature, making it visually appealing in both light and dark modes.

Features:

Front Page: A mockup of Facebookâ€™s landing page, styled to look familiar to users.
Profile Page: Includes a sample user profile layout, with sections for the profile picture, bio, posts, and friends list.
Dark Theme: Toggle between light and dark themes, providing a more comfortable viewing experience.
Technologies Used:

HTML: For structuring the web pages.
CSS: For styling, including layout, color schemes, and responsive design elements.
Future Improvements:

Add interactivity using JavaScript for a more dynamic user experience.
Implement additional pages like Settings, Friends List, and a News Feed.
